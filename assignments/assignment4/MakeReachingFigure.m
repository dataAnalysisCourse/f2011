%
% Given a filename containing properly formatted data of spike times
% from multiple trials of reaching to various targets, will create a nicely
% laid out figure with a different subplot showing the data for reaches in
% each direction. Each direction's subplot will show spike rasters from each
% trial in that direction, as well as a peristimulus time histogram showing
% the average spike rate in a given time after the trial started.
%
% This function is called with a specific channel (electrode) to be plotted
% 
% USAGE:         figh = MakeReachingFigure( filename, chan )
%
% INPUTS:        filename         Name of .mat file containing reachingData variable.
%                chan             Which electrode (channel) of data to plot.
% OUTPUTS:
%                figh             Handle of the resulting figure.

    % Create a figure. You might want to already give it a name 
    % by adding the optional argument pair figure('Name', yourNameHere) when calling figure.
    % Keep track of the figure handle with a variable; figh is the suggested variable name.

    % [ YOUR CODE HERE ]
    
    

    % Let's make this figure kind of large so it's easy to see the subplots as they are added in.
    % Note that you can always resize it later. To do this, set the 'Position' property of your
    % figure to be [screenXposition screenYPosition width height]. The screen position doesn't
    % really matter as long as it's visible. [1 1 1000 1000] would make the figure 1000x1000 pixels
    % and place it at the top-left of your screen. Note that on some linux machines this command
    % doesn't work for some reason; you'll have to just accept default size and manually drag-resize
    % the figure to suit you.

    %   Loop across the eight directions and create the subplot for each

    for iDir = 1 : numDirs       
        % Pull out the spike time data for this direction and this channel.
        % And put it into variable called thisDirSpiketimes.

        %                   CREATE THE SUBPLOT.
        % -----------------------------------------------------------
        % Recall that we want a 3x3 grid, and that each direction gets
        % plotted into one of the eight noncenter subplots.
        mySubplotIdx = directionIndexToSubplotLookup(iDir); % use this for the third
        % argument into subplot function to correctly choose at which location 
        % this direction's plot should be created.
        
        % Let's define variable myAxh to be the output of your call to subplot.
        % This will be the handle of the axis you've just created; you can pass this
        % and the requisite data into the specific raster, histogram, and region of interest
        % functions.

        % Now let's add code to draw the vertical line to mark target onset.
        % You may be wondering why I didn't suggest that this happen in drawRasters function.
        % This is ebcause we want the raster function to be widely reusable and thus
        % relatively narrow in its function. Thus, the way I've laid it out, it doesn't have 
        % an argument which would specifiy a location for a vertical line to mark target onset
        % (which is specific to this particular type of experiment.) Fortunately, since
        % you have the axis handle, you can call a line command which operates on
        % this axis handle right here in MakeReachingFigure.m. 
        % Draw a vertical line with x endpoints [targetOnT targetOnT]. 
        % You want the line to go from the bottom to the top
        % of the axis, so first get the ylim of the plot and use that in your line command,
        % similar to one of the in-class examples.

        % y tick labels greater than params.maxExpectedBinSpikes (i.e the tick labels
        % that would be to the left of the raster section of the plot.
        yticklabels = get( myAxh, 'YTickLabel' ); % Get the labels (will be a char array)
        numerical =  str2num( yticklabels ); % convert from characters to numbers

    %          Let's write some text into the center subplot
    % ******************************************************************
    % It's generally good to put some useful annotation into a figure

    % displayed.
    
    % Please define myAxh to be the center subplot
    % [ YOUR CODE HERE ]

    % Finally, go ahead and add these two lines of text into this center
    % figure.
    % Hint: use the text command. Use 'HorizontalAlignment', 'Center'
    % and 'VerticalAlignment', 'Bottom' (for top line of text)
    % and 'VerticalAlignment', 'Top' (for bottom line of text)
    % to make it much easier to choose correct x,y coordinates.
    % Hint2: Change the 'Interpreter' text property to 'None' so that
    % underscores do not cause the next character to be subscript.
