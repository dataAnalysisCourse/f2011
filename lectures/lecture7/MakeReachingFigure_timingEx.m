%
% Given a filename containing properly formatted data of spike times
% from multiple trials of reaching to various targets, will create a nicely
% laid out figure with a different subplot showing the data for reaches in
% that direction. Each direction's subplot will show spike rasters from each
% trial in that direction, as well as a peristimulus time histogram showing
% the average spike rate in a given time after the trial started.
%
% This function is called with a specific channel (electrode) to be plotted)
% 
% USAGE:         figh = MakeReachingFigure( filename, chan )
%
% INPUTS:        filename         Name of .mat file containing reachingData variable.
%                chan             Which electrode (channel) of data to plot.
% OUTPUTS:
%                figh             Handle of the resulting figure.
