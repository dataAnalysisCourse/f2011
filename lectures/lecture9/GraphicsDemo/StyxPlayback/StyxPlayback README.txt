OVERVIEW:

StyxPlayback is a graphical interface tool which allows you to read in a .styxlog file generated by a Styx game execution and replay the events of the game as they really appeared in a familiar, media-player like format. It also allows you to generate a .avi movie of the styx game replay using the attached Sytx Playback Movie Maker Tool.


INSTRUCTIONS:

       Run "StyxPlaybackGUI" to launch the GUI. The GUI should be fairly self-explanatory. Click "Load StyxLog" from the toolbar to find the .styxlog of interest. 

You should set StyxPlaybackGUI to interpret your .styxlog using the same version of Styx that was used to run the game. You can do this by changing the interpreter (from the "Change StyxSoftware" toolbar item) to point at the top-level Styx directory from the session software of interest. 

	When making a movie, it is recommended that you use compression or the resulting .avi file will be very large. Windows machines support the "Cinepak" compression. I'm not sure if Mac has a built-in Matlab compressor. 

	When you make a movie, the resolution of the resulting .avi will be exactly that of StyxGame window that the StyxPlayback tool opened. Shrink this down before pressing "Create Movie" to make a low-res movie.


KNOWN ISSUES:

    * Loading a StyxLog is very slow while it identifies all of the game objects and events. This can probably be optimized and I intend to eventually fix this. For now, expect it to take 30+ seconds to load a long (5+ minute) styx game's log.
